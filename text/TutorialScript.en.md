# 1. Movement
## 1.1 Introduction
Welcome to the ArenaShooter tutorial!
I am the announcer and I will guide you through the basics of this game.
You can leave any time by using the door in your inventory.
## 1.2 Double jumps
In arena, movement is key. The main movement technique is double jumping.
Performing a double jump is quite simple: First you jump, then,
in midair you press your jump key twice, like trying to enter flight mode in creative.
This will give you the boost into the direction you're looking.
Use double jumps to reach the lower platform.

## 1.3 Direction change
You can change the direction of the double jump in midair.
Try regular-jumping to the left of this obstacle and before activating double jump,
aim above the platform behind the obstacle to reach it with a redirected double jump.
Then proceed by reaching the top platform and jumping into the wind tunnel.

# 2. Starting weapons and ammo
## 2.1 Ammo
As you can see, falling doesn't hurt you in this game.
Let's talk about guns: knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your
and enemy's weapons is vital to get the advantage.
Most weapons require ammo to shoot, of which there are five types:
- Bullets (yellow),
- Shells (orange),
- Rockets (red)
- Lightning (white),
- and Cells (blue)
 
The type of ammo compatible with a weapon is usually color-coded and self-explanatory,
like machinegun using bullets, shotgun using shells and rocket launcher eating through rockets.
You can obtain ammo by picking up ammo boxes
and picking up weapons will yield a small amount of ammo of the type it uses.

Your amount of each type of ammo is shown above the hotbar.
Currently, you have none, so pick up some boxes to get some.

## 2.2 Starting weapons: gauntlet
Machine gun and gauntlet are starting items in deathmatch,
though other rulesets have their own starting items.
The gauntlet deals high damage in close range.
It's the only "gun" that doesn't use ammo,
but you have to get close and personal with your opponent.
Also, you fire all guns with the <key:key.use> key,
smacking people with your weapons does work in vanilla, but not here.
Try it out by killing that zombie.

## 2.3 Starting weapons: machinegun
Next, the machinegun: it deals low damage but is ranged.
Like starting weapons in other games, it is quite useless,
and you should concern yourself with finding something better on the map.
Try it out by killing that zombie.

# 3. Advanced weapons
Let's talk about the advanced weapons:
In deathmatch, you can find them lying around the map,
generating in the same places every time.
Instead of making you run circles around this tiny map, I'll give them all to you now.

Let's go over the weapons one-by-one:
The shotgun is your standard double-barrel with a pump-action sound.
It uses shells and if you manage to hit your target point-blank, it will light on fire!

The rocket launcher either uses rockets or kittens to shoot.
Though its main purpose is to blow things up, it can also be used to send things flying.
Predictably, it does a bit of damage to you as well.
But, there is a ruleset where this does not apply:
Rockets of Fun is centered wholly around the rocket launcher and the fun you can have with it.

The plasma gun if what you use if there are too many enemies nearby.
It's projectiles deal massive DPS and leave a massive hole in your cell budget.

The lightning gun is your primary tracking weapon.
It is an ammo-efficient solution to enemies with lots of armor.
The lightning gun unsurprisingly uses concentrated lightning to shoot.

The railgun is your primary sniping tool. It uses cells and does so quite efficiently.
If you have mastered flicking, you should have no trouble getting lots of 'impressives'.
If not, it has a rather long reload time during which you cannot use any other weapons.
You can train your flickshots by playing instagib,
where the railgun is the only weapon available and all hits guarantee a frag.

The BFG 9000 is actually closer to the 10K variant from Quake II.
The big friendly gun uses lots of lightning to shoot a big friendly ball
which disintegrates everyone in the room as long as you and it can see them.

Use your guns to get rid of the zombies and proceed to the next room

# 4. Rocket jumping
Shooting a rocket beneath you right after you jump
will send you flying places you can't get by just double jumping.
Try rocket jumping into that hole in the wall.

# 5. Powerups and armor
Lying around the map you can find various powerups.
All powerups are spawned with a set interval, at set places.
By powerups I also mean health and armor.
You don't get to regenerate health in arena.
Instead, you need to pick up medikits and stimpacks to account for damage you've taken.
You can also find armor that absorbs a 1/3rd of incoming damage until it is depleted.
Your current amount of armor points is displayed as your experience level.

Items like Mega Health can send your health and armor into overdrive.
By picking it up, you will have a brief period of your HP being over 20.

Then, there are major powerups like quad-damage and protection.
Those are worth fighting over as both will give you a significant advantage in combat.
Protection makes you take 50% less damage 
and Quad-damage will unsurprisingly 4x your outcoming damage.
But don't be overconfident, major powerups give x-ray vision on its holder,
and they are dropped on death.

# Conclusion
That is all I can currently tell you about the arena.
You will be returned to lobby where you can host and join games.

(You will also be given a cosmetic item for completing the tutorial)

Good luck!
